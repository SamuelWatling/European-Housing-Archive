# Whats Here?

Here is the code and data for my paper with Anthony Breach at the Centre for Cities [The Housebuilding Crisis](https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/the-housebuilding-crisis/). This contains a full replication dataset and code for both the summary statistics and graphs (Summary Replication.R) and the synthetic control method which estimated the counterfactual between housing outcomes in Britain compared with other European Countries (Counterfactual Replication.R). The methodology for the conterfactual is also provided under methodology.
